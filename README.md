Folders Description:
Games: WHERE YOU PUT YOUR GAME
Framework: all the logic related to settings/options/onlineplay/buttonmapping. 


HOW TO ADD YOUR GAME:
1- make your game
2-??
3- Create a folder for your game and put it in the Games folder

[steps related to how to pass how many players their games demand. Maybe a json for every game at root level]

Then when your game is over, reference back to Framework/Director with code that looks like the following 
//get_tree().change_scene_to_file("res://Main/Director.tscn")//
